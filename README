Although currently empty, this is the plan:

MHEG-5 code has an unusual structure and code flow, which can make programming difficult. While writing code I noticed that I was using several common patterns to emulate if statements, for loops, etc. I decided it would be simpler, and make my programs more reliable, if I automated this. 

This is a proof of concept, and therefore uses a very simple parsing method. A better approach would be to add these features to the BNF grammar.

Plan:
1) Add named variables.
    - Simple enough for the most part. However scope must be considered, especially with function calls.

2) Add function calls.
    - Could do this with code replacement, but this wouldn't allow recursion. Best approach depends on the cost of re-assigning variables. Best solution probably is to offer both inline and external functions.

3) If statements.
    - Simple conditionals first (a < b, b == c, etc)
    - Allow more complex conditionals in CNF or DNF
    - Convert any statement into equivalent CNF/DNF

4) While loop.
    - Simply an if statement with a call to the top again.

5) For loop.
    - Syntactic sugar for a while loop. Add first statement just before the while loop and the last just before the call.
